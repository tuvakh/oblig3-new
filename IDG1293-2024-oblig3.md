# IDG1293-2025-oblig3

This compulsory group activity will be an important component of your Project Portfolio, carrying significant weight in your final grade. However, notice that as an “oblig” this part will be graded as Approved/not Approved. 

# Goal

1. **Scroll telling and Story telling**: Utilise scroll telling techniques to guide users through the narrative of the project. Craft a compelling story using visual elements, animations, and interactive features to engage users and convey the message effectively.

2. **SVGs and CSS Drawing**: Experiment with SVGs and CSS for cool designs. Try filters, gradients, and custom shapes for dynamic visuals.

3. **Sass and BEM Implementation**: Utilise Sass preprocessing and BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology for efficient and maintainable CSS code. Organise stylesheets and components effectively to streamline development and enhance code readability.

4. **Accessibility and Responsiveness**: Make designs accessible. Consider user preferences like motion, colour, and device orientation.

5. **Interactive Elements with JavaScript and CSS**: Add interactive elements with JavaScript libraries like p5.js or GSAP. Use CSS for animations and transitions to engage users.

6. **Collaboration and Version Control**: Use Git and GitHub for teamwork and managing project versions. Work together effectively and communicate clearly. 

7. **Performance Optimisation**: Improve web performance with lazy loading and smaller file sizes. Understand how performance affects user experience and search rankings. Optimise the performance of scroll telling and interactive elements to ensure smooth and engaging user experiences.

8. **Design Principles and User Experience (UX)**: Focus on visual design, typography, and colour for appealing designs. Consider UX principles for organising information and user feedback. Ensure that the design enhances the storytelling experience and promotes user engagement.

# Introduction

In a world where chaos reigns supreme and the future looks as bright as a black hole, the United Nations has stumbled upon a revelation: we're teetering on the edge of oblivion! But hold onto your hats, because salvation isn't as far-fetched as it seems – it's right at your fingertips.

Picture this: the rivers run black with despair, the skies are choked with smog, and the last polar bear is considering a career change to penguin impersonator. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are our last lifeline, but they're about as effective as a sunshade in a supernova.

But fear not, for the UN has a plan – and it involves... wait for it... you! Yes, you heard it right. They're calling upon the digital daredevils and code commandos of our generation to rise up and be counted. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to take those dusty old SDGs and give them a makeover that'll make the Kardashians look like amateurs.

So, comrades, grab your keyboards and prepare for battle – it's time to take back the future! The fate of the world may hang in the balance, but hey, at least we'll have a laugh as we rewrite the apocalypse and save the day, one scroll-telling saga at a time!

# Context

In this "oblig" you will be presented with a brief description of the problem you have to solve. Have in mind the [Goal section](#Goal) when you design and implement your assignment. 

This is a group task, and you are required to build everything from the ground up. Although, you may use snippets of code from tutorials or official documentation, you must clearly acknowledge the sources in the comments of your code. Plagiarism or cheating will be deemed to have taken place if the submitted code shows substantial similarities to other students' assignments or projects found online. In such cases, the matter will be reported to the NTNU appeals committee for further examination. If you have any doubts regarding the use of materials for your project, please reach out to the instructor for clarification. 

It is imperative to deliver the assignment within the set deadline (never after).

## Task

Your task is to create **a captivating, animated, and scrollable web project that demonstrates mastery of advanced CSS techniques while delivering a compelling message**. Your choices in scroll direction, animations, layout, and typography should be deliberate and contribute to the overall impact of the project.

This project demands excellence, aiming for a high-quality outcome that is not only technically proficient but also ready for inclusion in your final portfolio. Your implementation of Sass, BEM methodology, and project architecture should adhere to best practices.

# Technical Requirements:

1. **GitHub Repository and Collaboration**:
   - Create a repository on GitHub Classroom (Link provided later).
   - Ensure all group members are listed as contributors ([who is a contributor](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/viewing-activity-and-data-for-your-repository/viewing-a-projects-contributors)).
   - **Create a README file that details** ([what is readme](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes)):
     - Project overview and purpose.
     - Points discussed during the braimstorming session.
     - Docunentation about the Storyboard created before implementing the website.
     - Instructions for getting started and link to Github pages.
     - Technology stack employed and list of animations, interactions and observers implemented.
   - Each group member must actively contribute through Git commits, pushes, and pull requests.
   - Use branches ([what are branches](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository))for individual features, with changes merged through pull requests ([what are pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)) and reviewed by group members ([how to request pull request review](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review) and [what is request review](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews))
   - The owner of the branch should manage the final merge to the `main` branch.
   - Publish the project using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

2. **CSS Architecture and Implementation**:
   - Develop a structured CSS architecture, emphasizing separation of concerns.
   - Employ Sass and BEM methodology.
   - Utilise SASS or CSS Variables effectively.
   - Implement advanced CSS features discussed in lectures, such as: SVG and animated SVG, Keyframe animations, Transitions and transformations. Accessibility features like prefers-reduced-motion, prefers-color-scheme, and orientation.
   - Consider the use of frameworks or libraris like GSAP or p5.js for animation.
   - Incorporate scroll storytelling techniques using Intersection Observer or alternative frameworks.

Your project should not only meet these technical requirements but also align with one of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). **Your storytelling and animations should effectively convey a message related to the chosen sustainability goal**, engaging users and raising awareness.

During the final presentation, your project will be showcased to other groups, potentially including students and teachers from other classes. Aim to create a project that not only meets the assignment criteria but also inspires and educates its audience.

To guide your aspirations, explore the provided examples, aiming for a level of creativity and impact similar to the showcased projects. Aim high and create a project that leaves a lasting impression, both visually and conceptually.

# Delivery

This assignment must be delivered in two different places: GitHub classroom and Blackboard. The project must also be deployed in GitHub pages. 

Finally, **groups will deliver their project presentations orally and on campus** (details provided on BB). Failure to meet at the designated time and location for oral presentations will result in a non-passing grade.

* To deliver the assignment in GitHub Classroom, you only need to make sure all your changes and commits are pushed to your Git repository.
    * A Pull request is created automatically when the repository is cloned. Feedback will be included there if needed. Do not remove or close that Pull Request.
    * Only the changes in the "main" branch will be considered the final version. Do not close the other branches since we will look how you have collaborated using Git.

* It is imperative that you work exclusively with this Git repository to ensure that all modifications are trackable and your code is backed up on a regular basis. Hence, you should commit your progress directly to this repository each time you make advancements.

* Before delivering the assignment in Blackboard, make sure your project has all the files it needs. Delete any file, folder or info that is not needed (e.g.: `.git/` folder). Zip the project and upload the file to Blackboard. 

* Include the link to your GitHub page on Blackboard when delivering the task there.

Good luck, and let your creativity shine!
